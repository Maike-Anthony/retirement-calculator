- **Taxes**: You can apply taxes either to the entire capital or only to interest earned.  
- **Withdrawal Rate**: Allows you to plan your annual withdrawals to generate a desired monthly income.  
- **Multiple Investment Periods**: Enter different monthly deposits for different periods of your life to simulate changing contributions over time.
- **Multiple Simulations**: Allows you to run multiple simulations and compare the results.
- **Export to a CSV File**: You can export the simulations to a CSV file.

The tool provides a **detailed summary**, including:

- Capital growth over time  
- Total deposits made  
- Interest earned  
- Taxes applied  
- Monthly income achievable with after-tax capital  
- A chart visualizing capital growth over time
